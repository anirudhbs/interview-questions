## Hacktoberfest Guidelines

Feel free to submit pull requests with your idea of what makes a good interview question. 

*I won't neccesarily accept it*. Basically this repo serves as a fairly opinionated collection of what _I_ think are good interview questions. 

That said, your pull request is a good faith suggestion - I'm happy to put the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label on - and more importantly, engage with you with validity of the suggestion.
