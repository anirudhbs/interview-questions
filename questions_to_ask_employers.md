## What does the performance review process look like?

**Person to ask** - Engineering manager, HR representative. 

- How often does it happen? 
- Is there a maximum on the kind of raise that can be given in a year? 
- Is there a bonus? 

**Purpose** - The answer to this question likely won't affect whether you want to work for the company or not. But it's good for you to know up front what the process is.


## What do you like most about working here?

**Person to ask** - A developer. 

**Purpose** - Is a good open ended cultural question, gives you a good indication of what the place is like. 

## What do you like the least about working here?

A more diplomatic phrasing would be - 'What are the difficult parts of the code that you have trouble with'. 

**Person to ask** - A developer. 

**Purpose** - If they dodge the question, it indicates a lack of honesty or forthright communication IMO, there's likely to be office politics at play, or it indicates that they're not confident that the company is worth working despite whatever difficulties they have. 

## Who is the customer/client that is currently best served by your product?

**Person to ask** Engineering manager

**Purpose** - If they can't answer it or give a fudgey answer, it indicates that the product is spinning in the mud. 


## Who is the customer/client that you are currently trying to win over

**Person to ask** Engineering manager

**Purpose** - As above, and gives you an indication of what the company is doing. 

## Do you use your product internally? 

Only applies for certain products. 

If they're not, it demonstrates that the product doesn't work very well.
